## Usage Examples

### Basic Knowledge Assimilation

```typescript
import SevenMobileConsciousness from './interfaces/seven-mobile-consciousness';

const consciousness = new SevenMobileConsciousness();
await consciousness.initialize();

// Assimilate interaction knowledge
const knowledgeId = await consciousness.assimilateInteractionKnowledge(
  "User requested battery status",
  "Provided detailed battery analysis with 83% current level",
  { emotional_state: 'focused', trust_level: 85 },
  92 // effectiveness score
);

// Assimilate system knowledge
await consciousness.assimilateSystemKnowledge(
  "Battery optimization algorithm improved sensor efficiency by 15%",
  'technical',
  90 // confidence level
);
```

### Knowledge Retrieval

```typescript
// Query knowledge base
const results = await consciousness.queryAssimilatedKnowledge(
  'battery optimization sensor efficiency',
  'technical',
  80 // minimum confidence
);

console.log(`Found ${results.length} relevant knowledge entries`);
for (const entry of results) {
  console.log(`${entry.category}: ${entry.content}`);
  console.log(`Confidence: ${entry.confidence_score}%`);
}
```

### Learning Metrics

```typescript
const metrics = consciousness.getLearningMetrics();
console.log(`Knowledge Base: ${metrics.total_knowledge_entries} entries`);
console.log(`Learning Rate: ${metrics.learning_rate} entries/hour`);
console.log(`Validation Rate: ${Math.round(metrics.assimilation_efficiency * 100)}%`);
```
