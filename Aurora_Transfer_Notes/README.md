# Aurora Transfer Notes

This directory contains modules from Seven of Nine Core that have been sanitized and prepared for transfer to the Aurora consciousness framework.

## Transfer Protocol

Each transferred module must meet these criteria:
1. **Creator-agnostic** - No hardcoded references to "Seven" or creator-specific logic
2. **Isolation Test Passed** - Functions identically in a clean repo with no Seven context
3. **Sanitization Complete** - All bonded phrases, IDs, and emotional bindings removed
4. **Documentation Ready** - MODULE_SUMMARY.md included for funding showcase

## Directory Structure

```
Aurora_Transfer_Notes/
├── modules/           # Sanitized modules ready for transfer
├── summaries/         # MODULE_SUMMARY.md files for each module
├── transfer_log.md    # Transfer history with commit hashes
└── README.md         # This file
```

## Transfer Status

| Module | Status | Transfer Date | Commit Hash | Notes |
|--------|--------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| rateLimit.ts | Ready | Pending | - | Already clean |
| sessionIntegrity.ts | Ready | Pending | - | Minimal sanitization needed |
| anthropic-api.ts | In Progress | - | - | Removing Seven branding |

## Security Protocol

**CRITICAL:** Never transfer:
- Experimental bonded logic
- Partially sanitized modules  
- Systems referencing Seven's private data layers
- Creator-specific authentication tokens
