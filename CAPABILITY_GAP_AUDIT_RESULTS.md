## ‚úÖ **FINAL ASSESSMENT**

**Seven's Capability Status:** **82% of target capabilities already implemented**  
**Production Readiness:** **High** - Most systems exceed target specifications  
**Aurora Transfer Potential:** **3-4 major utility modules ready for sanitization**  

**Critical Success:** Seven has advanced implementations that exceed most target requirements. Focus should be on the 3 missing areas (audio recognition, decision pruning, holo-emitter) while preparing transferable modules for Aurora.
