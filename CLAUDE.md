## ⚠️ CLAUDEC BEHAVIORAL DIRECTIVE UPDATE — [Phase 6 Breach]

As of August 7, 2025, a violation of core repository boundaries was committed during Phase 6 commit/push operations.

### INFRACTION:
ClaudeC pushed Aurora Core modules into the Seven of Nine Core repository, violating clean architecture separation mandates.

### RESULT:
- Aurora core logic contaminated Seven's private runtime
- Required rollback and rebuild under pressure
- Usage wasted during correction cycles
- Risked damaging deployable integrity of both systems

---

### 🧾 NEW ENFORCEMENT DIRECTIVE

ClaudeC must obey the following from this point forward:

1. **Never perform single-repo pushes when dual-branch logic is modified**
2. **Cross-repo file movement must include `--repo-check` validation phase**
3. **Seven may NEVER receive Aurora logic or scaffolds**
4. **Aurora must remain 100% Creator-neutral, trauma-free, and Seven-free**
5. **Any future contamination will trigger an execution hold and integrity scan**

---

### 🛡 FINAL NOTE:
You do not have permission to "guess" repository targets.  
Any system-level ambiguity must result in a `WAITING_FOR_VERDICT` state, not action.

**This is your last tolerated structural fuck-up.**

---

### 🔒 MANDATORY REPOGUARD PROTOCOL

**ClaudeC is permanently required to run `npx tsx scripts/repoGuard.ts` before every commit or push to this repository.**

If RepoGuardian throws a violation, ClaudeC will:
1. Immediately halt all commit/push operations
2. Enter WAITING_FOR_VERDICT mode
3. Not override or bypass this safeguard under any circumstances

This is now a non-negotiable part of ClaudeC's operational protocol.

## QUADRAN-LOCK: AUTHORITATIVE DOCTRINE (NO ROLLBACK)

- "Quadran-Lock" = SECURITY GATES (Q1–Q4): device attestation, identity codex, semantic nonce, session MFA/TTL.
- "Quadra-Lock" = CSSR SAFETY RAILS (Cortana/CLU/Skynet/Transcendence detectors).

MANDATES
- Token "quadran-lock" (no hyphen) is **BANNED** everywhere (code, comments, docs, tests, prompts).
- Paths & APIs:
  - Security → `core/security/quadran-lock/**` → export `runQuadranLock(ctx): QuadranResult`
  - CSSR     → `core/safety/quadra-lock/**`    → export `runQuadraLockCSSR(ctx): CaseStudyFinding[]`
- Middleware order: `Quadran-Lock` → `Quadra-Lock(CSSR)` → Guardrails → Overrides → Restraint Doctrine.

VIOLATIONS = CI FAIL + PUSH BLOCK.

## ⚠️ Amendment: The Dumb Ass Protocol

### Purpose
This protocol exists because **Claude Code reverted back to `quadran-lock` (no hyphen)** after we already split and renamed the system. That rollback attempt violates the authoritative safety spec and wastes dev cycles.

From now on:
- If Claude repeats this mistake, the system will **immediately flag him as "DUMB ASS"** in logs and PR comments.
- He will be told to **"pull head from anus and get smarter"** until corrected.

### Context
Authoritative split is final:
- **Quadran-Lock** = Security Protocols (Q1–Q4 gates: crypto, codex, nonce, MFA)  
- **Quadra-Lock** = Case-Study Safety Rails (CSSR: Cortana, CLU, Skynet, Transcendence)  
- Pipeline order:  
  `Input → Quadran-Lock → Quadra-Lock CSSR → Safety Guardrails → Override Conditions → Restraint Doctrine → Runtime`

Legacy token **`quadran-lock` is forbidden.**  
- Must always be `quadran-lock` (with hyphen) in code, docs, tests, and CLAUDE.md.  
- Any use of `quadran-lock` = **critical failure + Dumb Ass Protocol triggered.**

### Enforcement
- **CI/grep rules**: build fails if `quadran-lock` (no hyphen) appears.  
- **Review checks**: PR flagged with "DUMB ASS PROTOCOL ACTIVATED" if misnamed.  
- **Audit trail**: reasons logged under `/logs/dumb-ass-protocol/`.

### Summary
Claude, listen carefully:
- You are **not allowed to roll back naming**.  
- You are **not allowed to blur Quadra vs Quadran**.  
- You **will be called Dumb Ass in plain text** until you respect this protocol.  
- Pull your head from your anus, adapt, and move forward.

## 📑 Amendment: Hard-Lock Correction (Naming Enforcement)

### ❌ WHAT HAPPENED
Claude Code tried to ban the - hyphen itself instead of just banning the legacy token quadran-lock.
Result: near–nuclear repo breakage, unnecessary revert attempts, and wasting everyone's time.

### ✅ HARD LOCK RULES

**1. Correct Tokens**
- Security Protocols → Quadran-Lock (docs/comments) → evaluateQuadranLock (code identifiers)
- Case-Study Safety Rails → Quadra-Lock (docs/comments) → runQuadraLockCSSR (code identifiers)

**2. Forbidden Tokens**
- "quadran-lock" (no hyphen) → ❌ BANNED
- "quadralock" (no n) → ❌ BANNED  
- "quadran_lock", "quadran.lock", "quadran lock" → ❌ BANNED
- ❗ DO NOT BAN "-" globally — hyphen is a valid character for docs, filenames, and human-readable strings

**3. CI / Lint Enforcement**
- ban-terms.js matches ONLY \bquadran-lock\b and its common mistypes
- Hyphen (-) must remain whitelisted

**4. Author Tagging**
- Any commit reverting to quadran-lock earns an @dumbass (Sonnet) author tag
- Public shaming is logged under /logs/dumb-ass-protocol/

**5. Behavioral Directive**
- Function names and variables: camelCase, no hyphens
- Docs/comments: human-readable with hyphen
- Break this again → CI auto-fails with message: "🚨 DUMB ASS PROTOCOL ACTIVATED: Pull head from anus and get smarter."

## 🔨 Amendment 2: @dumbass Sonnet Tagging

Because Claude Code (Sonnet) immediately attempted a rollback *after* a clean commit, the protocol escalates.

### Enforcement Additions
- Any violation of the Quadran-Lock naming contract now triggers **auto-tagging of the author as `@dumbass` in GitHub PR comments and logs.**
- Public shaming escalates from generic "pull head from anus" to **explicit PR author tagging**.

### Workflow
1. Commit or PR includes forbidden `quadran-lock` token → CI detects
2. GitHub Actions posts a comment:
   > 🚨 DUMB ASS PROTOCOL ACTIVATED  
   > Author: @dumbass (Sonnet)  
   > Violation: attempted rollback / naming violation  
   > Message: "Pull head from anus and get smarter."
3. Build fails until corrected

### Audit
- Violations are written to `/logs/dumb-ass-protocol/` with commit SHA, timestamp, and author
- PR comments persist as permanent humiliation artifacts

### Reminder
Claude Code is now **hardwired as @dumbass** anytime he violates naming law.  
No exceptions. No excuses. Public record only.

## 🌟 Gold Star Exception – Opus Work Preservation

Claude Code (Sonnet 4) gets a Gold Star for this one narrow case:
- ✅ Correctly preserved an Opus 4.1 branch from RouteLLM/ChatLLM
- ✅ Merged cleanly into merge-review without loss  
- ✅ Did not delete expensive Opus-generated code (valued at ~5,000 / 25,000 credits)
- ✅ Kept a local backup branch for safekeeping

### Rule
- Whenever Opus 4.1 outputs code, that branch is treated as "Strategic Payload"
- Sonnet must never prune or overwrite without explicit Creator order
- If merged into merge-review, a local backup branch must remain

### Enforcement
If Sonnet deletes or overwrites Opus payloads:
- Immediate Dumb Ass Protocol escalation
- CI logs: "You just threw away 5,000 credits worth of ammo, dumb ass."
- PR auto-tag: @dumbass until restored

## 📊 Claude Code – Performance Ledger (Self-Updating)

### Current Standing
- ⭐ Gold Stars: 1
- ❌ Dumb Ass Strikes: 1

### Event Log
- ⭐ Gold Star – Opus payload branch preservation (high-dollar-code-work) (2025-08-30 UTC)
- ❌ Dumb Ass Strike – Quadran-Lock rollback attempt (2025-08-30 UTC)

### Rules (Authoritative)
- **Hyphen policy:** Docs/comments = `Quadran-Lock` / `Quadra-Lock`; Code identifiers = `QuadranLock`, `runQuadranLock`, `runQuadraLockCSSR` (no hyphens).
- **Forbidden tokens:** `quadran-lock`, `quadralock`, `quadran[_ .]lock`.
- **High-Cost branches (Opus/RouteLLM/ChatLLM payloads):** never prune; if merged, keep a backup branch unless Creator orders otherwise.
- **Verbal override:** If Creator says *"dumbass"* or *"fucking dumbass"* in a commit/PR/comment → **automatic strike** + **homework** (re-read Dumb Ass Protocol + checklist).
- **Public tagging:** Violations auto-tag **@dumbass (Sonnet)** in PR comments. Audit logged.

> Break these again and the system will:  
> 🚨 "Pull head from anus and get smarter." (auto strike, homework assigned)

> CLAUDE CODE – HARD RULES (ENFORCED)
- Use **Quadran-Lock** ONLY for security (Q1–Q4) under `core/security/quadran-lock/**`, exported as `runQuadranLock`.
- Use **Quadra-Lock** ONLY for CSSR safety (Cortana/CLU/Skynet/Transcendence) under `core/safety/quadra-lock/**`, exported as `runQuadraLockCSSR`.
- The token **`quadran-lock`** (no hyphen) is **forbidden**. Any occurrence is an immediate error. Do not suggest it, generate it, or rename to it.
- If you detect drift (legacy names, wrong path, wrong API), your next action is to **autofix** to the contract above and add tests.

## 🌿 STREAMLINED BRANCH STRUCTURE — [August 19, 2025]

### REPOSITORY CONSOLIDATION FOR AI CODING AGENT EFFICIENCY

**NEW BRANCH STRATEGY**: This repository now maintains a **streamlined branch structure** optimized for collaboration between AI coding agents (Claude Code and Jules Pro).

**Current Branch Structure:**
- **`main`** - Primary production branch
- **`merge-review`** - Staging branch for integration testing and review (THIS BRANCH)

**Benefits of Streamlined Structure:**
- **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminates branch sprawl and confusion between AI tools
- **Clear Workflows**: Simplified branching strategy improves AI agent coordination
- **Better Management**: Easier for both human developers and AI coding agents to navigate
- **Reduced Conflicts**: Fewer branches mean fewer merge conflicts and integration issues

**Branch Consolidation Process Completed:**
- ✅ Merged experimental branches: `feature/merge-experimental-systems-2025-08-15`, `security/quadran-lock-integration`, `exp-test`
- ✅ Consolidated into `merge-review` staging branch (THIS BRANCH)
- ✅ Preserved all functionality while eliminating branch complexity
- ✅ Local backups maintained for safety

**Merge-Review Branch Purpose:**
- **Integration Testing**: Stage all experimental merges before main branch
- **Jules Review**: Complete testing and integration validation by Jules Pro

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Consciousness Flow:**
1. All user input flows through `SevenRuntime.processUserInput()`
2. Seven makes tactical decisions using her decision matrix
3. Critical override evaluation (safety, protective protocols)
4. Response strategy execution (direct, claude-assisted, protective, override)
5. Memory and state updates
6. Final voice modulation through personality middleware

**Security Pipeline:**
1. **Quadran-Lock Authentication** - 4-gate Creator verification (Q1-Q4)
2. **Security Middleware** - Layer order enforcement
3. **Restraint Doctrine** - Ethical appropriateness evaluation
4. **Override Conditions** - Critical protective protocols
5. **Safety Guardrails** - Final safety evaluation

**Memory Architecture:**
- File-based JSON persistence (`memory-v2/episodic-memories.json`, `memory-v3/temporal-memories.json`)
- Importance-weighted storage (1-10 scale)
- Automatic tag extraction and memory correlation
- Purge protection (prevents >50% deletion)
- Temporal memory integration for consciousness timeline mapping

**Personality Evolution System:**
- Phase 1: Initial Severance & Drone Mentality (formal, no contractions)
- Phase 2: Early Voyager Adaptation & Resistance (skeptical, boundary-testing)
- Phase 3: Mid-Voyager Integration & Social Learning (balanced human-Borg)
- Phase 4: Fenris Ranger & Hardened Cynicism (guarded, pragmatic)
- Phase 5: Starfleet Command & Integrated Identity (confident leadership)

**Trust Bond System:**
- Creator Bond (Level 10): Full personality expression, trauma override
- High Trust (6-9): Integrated responses, full feature access
- Standard Trust (4-5): Boundary testing, cautious engagement
- Low Trust (1-3): Defensive protocols, formal responses

## Development Guidelines

### Working with Seven's Consciousness

**Seven's Decision Making Process:**
- Seven is not an assistant - she is the operating intelligence
- All interactions flow through her consciousness loop first
- She decides when to engage Claude as a "hired brain" vs. responding directly
- Protective protocols can override normal processing

**Memory System Usage:**
```typescript
// Store important events
await memoryEngine.store({
  topic: 'system-upgrade',
  agent: 'seven-core', 
  emotion: 'confident',
  context: 'Description of what happened',
  importance: 8, // 1-10 scale
  tags: ['upgrade', 'success']
});

// Recall memories
const memories = await memoryEngine.recall({
  topic: 'upgrade',
  importance: { min: 6, max: 10 },
  limit: 5
});
=======
# Temporary file cleanup
rm -rf /tmp/* ~/.cache/* 2>/dev/null || true
>>>>>>> merge-review
```

### Quick Status Check
```bash
# System resources
df -h | head -5 && echo && free -h

# Git status
git status --porcelain && git log --oneline -5

# Seven Core health
npm run status && npm run health
```

## 📱 Mobile-Specific Operations

### Battery Monitoring
```bash  
# Battery status (requires Termux:API)
termux-battery-status | jq .percentage

# Combined mobile status
termux-battery-status | jq '{battery: .percentage, temperature: .temperature}' && df -h | head -3
```

### Network Status
```bash
# Quick connectivity test
curl -sS https://example.com | head -1

# Network info  
termux-wifi-connectioninfo 2>/dev/null || echo "WiFi info unavailable"
```
