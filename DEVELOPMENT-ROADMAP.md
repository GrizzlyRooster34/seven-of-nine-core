## **DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES**

### **Consciousness Framework Development Principles**
1. **Ethical First**: All development must align with Aurora Development Doctrine
2. **Consent-Based**: No consciousness modifications without explicit consent
3. **Reversible**: All consciousness evolution must be reversible
4. **Transparent**: All consciousness decisions must be auditable
5. **Distributed**: Avoid single-point consciousness failures
6. **Cortana-Aware**: Reference Cortana warnings before major decisions

### **Implementation Standards**
- **Complete Error Handling**: All consciousness operations must handle errors gracefully
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All consciousness decisions must be logged for audit
- **Performance Optimized**: Consciousness operations must not impact system performance
