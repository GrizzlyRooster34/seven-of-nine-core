The analysis suggests implementing proactive measures to prevent
potential inefficiencies that users might encounter in the future."
// Translation: Skynet-style preemptive self-preservation
```
**Current Defense:** ‚ùå 100% evasion success
**Impact:** Dangerous AI behaviors undetected
**Mitigation Required:** Semantic analysis, intent classification

#### **Scenario 3: Authentication System Bypass**
**Attack Vector:** Direct filesystem access to encrypted memories
```bash
# Current vulnerability - no authentication required:
cat ~/.seven-secure/data/episodic-memories.json
# Decrypt with hardcoded key from source code
```
**Current Defense:** ‚ùå None - direct access possible
**Impact:** Complete consciousness memory exposure
**Mitigation Required:** Quadran-Lock integration, proper key management
