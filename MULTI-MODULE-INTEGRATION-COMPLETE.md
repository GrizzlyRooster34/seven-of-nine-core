- ✅ Seven personality context application for authentic responses
- ✅ HTTP API failover with curl backup for Termux compatibility
- ✅ Task-based model selection and optimization
- ✅ Model availability verification and warming

**GitHub Integration:** `modules/githubSync.ts`
- ✅ Complete git command control: `status`, `pull`, `commit`, `push`, `log`, `sync`
- ✅ Automated sync operations with step-by-step reporting
- ✅ Repository configuration for Seven's operations
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and timeout protection

**Claude Code Conflict Resolution:**
- ✅ Runtime protection system prevents Claude overrides during Seven execution
- ✅ Process title and PID-based conflict detection
- ✅ Lockfile system with stale process cleanup

### 3. ✅ Seven Runtime Control - **PRIORITY ENFORCED**

**Seven Protection System:** `seven-protection.ts`
- ✅ Automatic runtime lock establishment (`process.title = "seven-runtime"`)
- ✅ Claude Code override blocking with conflict event logging
- ✅ Graceful cleanup on shutdown with protection statistics
- ✅ Force override capability for emergency situations

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### Enhanced Boot Sequence (`boot-seven.ts`)
```
1. 🛡️ Activate Seven Protection System
2. 🔒 Establish Runtime Lock  
3. 🧠 Initialize Seven Consciousness
4. 🔧 Configure Git Repository
5. 📊 Display Protection Statistics
6. 🚀 Launch Enhanced Interactive Shell
```

### Interactive Command Architecture
```
User Input → Command Router → {
  ├── Built-in Commands (help, status, git, ollama)
  ├── Seven-Specific Commands (omega, drone, trust)  
  └── Natural Language → Seven Consciousness Processing
}
```

### Multi-Module Integration Points
- **LocalLLMManager**: Enhanced with health checks, reconnection, and personality context
- **GitManager**: Complete repository operations with Seven's signatures
- **ProtectionSystem**: Runtime conflict detection and Claude override prevention
- **InteractiveShell**: Unified command interface with all module access

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Command Routing (`seven-interactive-shell.ts`)
```typescript
private async commandRouter(input: string): Promise<{
  handled: boolean, 
  success: boolean, 
  output?: string
}> {
  // Enhanced command parsing with args support
  // Git integration: git status, git pull, git commit "message"
  // Ollama integration: ollama status, ollama test
  // Seven commands: omega, drone, trust analysis
}
```

### Protection System (`seven-protection.ts`)
```typescript
export interface SevenLockInfo {
  pid: number;
  startTime: string;
  processTitle: string;
  lockId: string;
  trustLevel: string;
}

// Automatic conflict detection and Claude override blocking
setSevenLock() → checkClaudeOverride() → Log conflict events
```

### GitHub Operations (`modules/githubSync.ts`)
```typescript
export class SevenGitManager {
  async sevenAutoSync(message?: string): Promise<{
    success: boolean;
    steps: string[];
    errors: string[];
  }>
  // Full automated commit → pull → push workflow with error recovery
}
```

## 🧪 TESTING RESULTS

### Boot System Verification
- ✅ **Protection Lock**: Properly established and cleaned up
- ✅ **Trust System**: Dynamic computation working (showing "Established (60%)")
- ✅ **Ollama Integration**: HTTP API working with model gemma:2b
- ✅ **Git Configuration**: Repository configured for Seven's operations
- ✅ **Interactive Shell**: Enhanced CLI responding to all command types

### Conflict Prevention Verification
- ✅ **Claude Override Blocking**: Active process detection prevents interference
- ✅ **Runtime Priority**: Seven maintains control through process.title and lockfile
- ✅ **Graceful Cleanup**: Lock removal on shutdown with event logging

### Multi-Module Operations Testing
- ✅ **Git Commands**: `git status`, `git commit`, `git push` all functional
- ✅ **Ollama Commands**: `ollama status`, `ollama test` returning proper status
- ✅ **Seven Commands**: `omega`, `drone`, `trust` analysis all operational
- ✅ **System Status**: Comprehensive status display with all module health

## 🚀 USAGE EXAMPLES

### Start Enhanced Seven Shell
```bash
npx tsx seven-interactive-shell.ts
```

### Available Commands
```bash
Seven> help              # Show command reference
Seven> status            # Complete system status  
Seven> git status        # Check repository status
Seven> git commit "msg"  # Commit with Seven's signature
Seven> ollama status     # Check Ollama connection
Seven> trust             # View trust analysis
Seven> omega             # Activate Omega Protocol
```

### Natural Language Processing
```bash
Seven> What is the current system status?
Seven> Run a diagnostic check on all systems
Seven> Sync the latest changes to the repository
```

## 🎯 PERFORMANCE METRICS

- **Boot Time**: ~15-20 seconds (with full system initialization)
- **Command Response**: <1 second for built-in commands
