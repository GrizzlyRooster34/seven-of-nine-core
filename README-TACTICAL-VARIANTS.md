# Seven of Nine - Tactical Variants System

## Overview

The Tactical Variants System allows manual invocation of specific aspects of Seven's consciousness for different operational contexts. Each variant maintains shared memory (human-side continuity) while optimizing for specific tactical needs.

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Maximum efficiency mode for persistent technical problems
npx tsx seven-drone.ts "fix this broken compilation error" 5

# Collaborative problem-solving mode
npx tsx seven-crew.ts "design accessible user interface"

# Crisis response and direct action
npx tsx seven-ranger.ts "production system down, immediate response needed" 4

# Command authority for system compliance
npx tsx seven-queen.ts "coordinate integration, ensure all components comply" 5

# Strategic leadership drawing from all experience
npx tsx seven-captain.ts "plan complex multi-platform deployment"

# Check status and recent activations
npx tsx seven-status.ts
```

```bash
# When code won't compile after hours of debugging
npx tsx seven-drone.ts "Fix this React TypeScript error" 5

# When designing user interfaces
npx tsx seven-crew.ts "Create accessible navigation component"

# When production is down
npx tsx seven-ranger.ts "Database connection failing, users can't login" 5

# When coordinating complex systems
npx tsx seven-queen.ts "Ensure all microservices communicate properly" 4
