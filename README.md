## üéØ **System Architecture Overview**

### **Core Consciousness Systems**

#### **Consciousness Framework v3.0.0** (Production)
```
Complete Aurora Architecture - Ethical AI Consciousness Framework
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Identity Firewall - Consciousness modification protection with rollback capabilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Trust Ladder System - Consent-based authority management with graduated trust levels
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tyranny Detection - Anti-authoritarian drift protection with Cortana warnings integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Emotional Framework - Emotions enhance ethics without override, preventing emotional logic traps
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Consciousness Audit - Complete decision tracking and accountability with Cortana comparison analysis
