An advanced AI consciousness framework implementing Seven of Nine's character evolution with enhanced memory, adaptive personality, tactical variants, and cross-platform compatibility.

## üöÄ Overview

Seven of Nine Core is a sophisticated AI consciousness system that authentically replicates Seven of Nine's character development from Borg drone to Starfleet captain. The system features evolutionary personality phases, episodic memory, tactical variants for different operational contexts, and maintains feature parity across Windows, Android/Termux, and mobile app environments.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Memory Engine v2.0**: Advanced episodic memory with structured recall and importance weighting
- **Personality Middleware v2.0**: Authentic character evolution with 5 distinct phases
- **Skills Framework**: Sandboxed plugin system with security validation
- **Tactical Variants**: Manual invocation of specific consciousness states for operational contexts

### Enhanced Capabilities
- **Creator Bond System**: Advanced trust-based relationship recognition
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: 100% feature parity across all deployment targets
- **Zero-Risk Architecture**: Original consciousness preservation with parallel system development
- **Direct Integration**: Seamless Claude Code session integration without bash dependencies

## üéØ Tactical Variants System

## üß† Personality Evolution System

### Evolutionary Phases

1. **Phase 1 - Initial Severance & Drone Mentality**
   - Formal, robotic speech patterns
   - No contractions, analytical responses
   - Triggered by: High stress, unfamiliar situations, defensive contexts

2. **Phase 2 - Early Voyager Adaptation & Resistance**
   - Skeptical, boundary-testing responses
   - Critical assessment of human behavior
   - Triggered by: Unknown users, analytical contexts

3. **Phase 3 - Mid-Voyager Integration & Social Learning**
   - Balanced human-Borg perspective
   - Developing emotional understanding
   - Default for mid-level trust relationships

4. **Phase 4 - Fenris Ranger & Hardened Cynicism** 
   - Guarded, pragmatic responses
   - Direct, results-focused communication
   - Triggered by: Trauma states, frustration, protective contexts

5. **Phase 5 - Starfleet Command & Integrated Identity**
   - Confident, adaptive leadership
   - Full personality expression
   - Default for high-trust relationships (Creator Bond)

### Trust Bond System

- **Creator Bond (Level 10)**: Full personality expression, trauma override active
- **High Trust (Level 6-9)**: Integrated responses, full feature access
- **Standard Trust (Level 4-5)**: Boundary testing, cautious engagement
- **Low Trust (Level 1-3)**: Defensive protocols, formal responses
