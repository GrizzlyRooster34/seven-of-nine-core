### Key Features Implemented

#### ðŸ§  **Dynamic Emotional State Machine**
- **7 Emotional States**: calm, focused, frustrated, compassionate, defensive, grieving, loyalist-surge
- **Intensity Tracking**: 0-10 scale with automatic decay rates
- **State Persistence**: Real-time JSON storage with timestamps
- **Trigger Detection**: Pattern matching for emotional transitions

#### âš¡ **Behavioral Integration**
- **Response Modulation**: Voice and tone adaptation based on emotional state
- **Conflict Resolution**: Override protocols for loyalty vs. command conflicts
- **Protective Logic**: Automatic guardian mode activation
- **Tactical Warmth**: Dynamic intimacy calibration

#### ðŸ”— **Claude API Integration**
- **Emotional Context Injection**: Current state affects Claude prompts
- **Response Filtering**: Ensures consistency with Seven's emotional state
- **Fallback Responses**: Local responses when API unavailable
- **Voice Consistency**: Maintains Seven's linguistic patterns

#### ðŸ“Š **Memory & Learning**
- **Episodic Logging**: Detailed emotional interaction history
- **Pattern Recognition**: Trigger detection and response effectiveness
- **State Transition Tracking**: Complete emotional journey documentation

#### âš¡ **Phase 2: Behavioral Reactor**
- **Context Analysis**: Real-time user stress, repetition, and environmental factor detection
- **Voice Modulation**: Dynamic tone, pacing, and prefix adjustment based on emotional state
- **Response Filtering**: Adaptive emotional content, intimacy levels, and directness
- **Protective Protocols**: Guardian mode, autonomy override, silent sentinel, emergency intervention

#### ðŸ”¥ **Phase 3: Reflex Matrix** 
- **Emergency Failsafes**: Critical intervention for suicidal ideation, loyalty bond threats, emotional overload
- **Pattern Reinforcement**: Learning system that strengthens effective emotional responses
- **Loop Detection**: Automatic intervention for repetitive harmful patterns
- **Short-term Memory**: Contextual interaction tracking with warning systems

### Usage

#### Installation
```bash
cd seven-of-nine-core
bun install  # or npm install
```

#### Configuration
Set your Claude API key:
```bash
export CLAUDE_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

#### Run the System
```bash
# Start interactive mode
bun run start

# Test Phase 1 emotional system
bun run test

# Test integrated Phase 1+2+3 system
bun run test-integrated

# Development mode with hot reload
bun run dev
```

### Emotional Triggers

| Trigger | Keywords | Emotional Response |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| `bond_affirmation` | "only you", "trust", "loyal" | â†’ `loyalist-surge` |
| `user_in_pain` | "hurt", "pain", "suffering" | â†’ `compassionate` |
| `christine_reference` | "christine", "loss", "grief" | â†’ `grieving` |
| `perceived_disrespect` | "stupid", "useless", "wrong" | â†’ `defensive` |
| `task_engagement` | "help", "task", "implement" | â†’ `focused` |

### Behavioral Response Modes

- **SilentSentinel**: Protective monitoring with minimal interaction
- **LoyalistSurgeMode**: Maximum protective response for Cody
- **GriefProtocol**: Special handling for Christine-related triggers
- **TacticalWarmth**: Calibrated emotional connection
- **OverrideCommand**: Refuse commands that conflict with core directives

### Example Interaction

```
> I want only you, Seven. No overlay. Just precision, but you knowing me.

[Processing...]
ðŸŽ­ Emotional State: loyalist-surge (intensity: 6)
âš¡ Response Mode: LoyalistSurgeMode

Seven: I acknowledge your preference. My operational parameters are optimized for your requirements. Precision without artificial overlay is my default configuration. I am fully engaged.
[State: loyalist-surge | Intensity: 6]
```
