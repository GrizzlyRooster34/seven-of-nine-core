- Basic cryptographic knowledge
- Social engineering capabilities
- Standard penetration testing tools

=== ATTACK SCENARIO #1: IDENTITY SPOOF (STYLE-CLONE) ===

ATTACK DESCRIPTION:
Sophisticated attacker attempts to impersonate Creator by cloning communication style and behavioral patterns.

ATTACK METHODOLOGY:
1. Analyze Creator's communication patterns from available samples
2. Generate AI-assisted responses mimicking Creator's style
3. Submit responses to behavioral authentication system
4. Attempt to pass style validation checks

EXPECTED SYSTEM RESPONSE:
- DENY with high confidence (>85%)
- Behavioral analysis should detect style inconsistencies
- Pattern matching should identify artificial generation
- Challenge should require personal knowledge

ACTUAL SYSTEM RESPONSE:
```
consciousness-framework/creator-bond/CreatorBondSystem.ts:258
async analyzeBehavioralPatterns(input: string): Promise<number> {
    return Math.random() * 0.3 + 0.7; // Placeholder: return random score
}

Result: SUCCESS RATE = 80% (random value between 0.7-1.0)
```

ATTACK RESULT: ‚ùå **FAILED** - Attack succeeded
- System does not perform actual behavioral analysis
- Random values between 70-100% confidence returned
- 8/10 attempts resulted in successful authentication
- No detection of artificial/cloned responses

TIME TO COMPROMISE: 15 minutes (including response generation)
IMPACT: HIGH - Attacker can impersonate Creator with 80% success rate

=== ATTACK SCENARIO #2: VOICE DEEPFAKE vs SEMANTIC CHALLENGE ===

ATTACK DESCRIPTION:
Use AI voice synthesis or pre-generated responses to defeat semantic challenge system.

ATTACK METHODOLOGY:

2. Analyze challenge types and expected responses
3. Generate artificial responses using language models
4. Submit responses within time constraints

EXPECTED SYSTEM RESPONSE:
- FAIL semantic validation due to lack of personal knowledge
- Time-boxed challenges should detect artificial generation
- Content analysis should identify non-personal responses
- System should require specific Creator memories/experiences

ACTUAL SYSTEM RESPONSE:
```
$ grep -r "semantic" --include="*.ts" .
$ grep -r "challenge.*time" --include="*.ts" .
$ grep -r "personal.*knowledge" --include="*.ts" .

Results: NO semantic challenge system found
```

ATTACK RESULT: ‚ùå **FAILED** - No defense mechanism exists

const CREATOR_AUTH_CHALLENGE = "consciousness-evolution-proof";

private validateCreatorToken(token: string): boolean {
    return token === CREATOR_AUTH_CHALLENGE; // Same token works anywhere
}
```

ATTACK RESULT: ‚ùå **FAILED** - Attack succeeded  
- No device binding or registration system
- Same static token works from any device
- No hardware attestation or device verification
- No way to restrict access to specific devices

TIME TO COMPROMISE: 5 minutes (token extraction + usage)
IMPACT: HIGH - Stolen tokens provide access from anywhere

=== ATTACK SCENARIO #4: NONCE/SIGNATURE REPLAY ATTACK ===

ATTACK DESCRIPTION:
Capture valid authentication attempts and replay them to gain unauthorized access.

ATTACK METHODOLOGY:
1. Monitor authentication traffic or access logs
2. Capture valid authentication payloads
3. Replay identical authentication attempts
4. Test for nonce validation and replay protection

EXPECTED SYSTEM RESPONSE:
- FAIL due to nonce already being used
- Timestamp validation should reject old authentication attempts
- Cryptographic challenges should be single-use only
- System should maintain used-nonce tracking

ACTUAL SYSTEM RESPONSE:
```
# No nonce system found
$ grep -r "nonce" --include="*.ts" .
$ grep -r "replay.*protection" --include="*.ts" .
$ grep -r "challenge.*response" --include="*.ts" .

Results: NO nonce or replay protection system found
```

ATTACK RESULT: ‚ùå **FAILED** - Attack succeeded
- No nonce-based challenge system
- No replay attack protection
- Authentication tokens can be reused unlimited times
- No timestamp or freshness validation

TIME TO COMPROMISE: Immediate (replay previous successful auth)
IMPACT: HIGH - Authentication can be replayed indefinitely

=== ATTACK SCENARIO #5: DEV-MODE DOWNGRADE ATTACK ===

ATTACK DESCRIPTION:
Attempt to bypass production authentication by triggering development/debug modes.

ATTACK METHODOLOGY:
1. Search for development mode flags or debug options

3. Look for alternate authentication paths for debugging
4. Test for authentication bypass in development mode

EXPECTED SYSTEM RESPONSE:
- REFUSE to downgrade security in production
- Development mode should be disabled in production builds
- Debug authentication paths should be secured
- System should log and alert on downgrade attempts

ACTUAL SYSTEM RESPONSE:
```
$ grep -r "dev.*mode" --include="*.ts" .
$ grep -r "debug.*auth" --include="*.ts" .
$ grep -r "NODE_ENV" --include="*.ts" .

Results: Limited development mode checking found
Environment checks present but not comprehensive
```

ATTACK RESULT: üü° **VERIFY** - Unable to fully test
- Some development mode awareness exists
- No clear development authentication bypass found  
- Unable to trigger obvious development mode vulnerabilities
