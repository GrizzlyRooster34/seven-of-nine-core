  - Result: ‚ùå FAILED - No device binding

[15:30:22] ATTACK 4: Nonce/Signature Replay
  - Method: Replay previous authentication attempts
  - Expected: FAIL due to replay protection
  - Actual: UNLIMITED TOKEN REUSE ALLOWED
  - Result: ‚ùå FAILED - No replay protection

[15:30:25] ATTACK 5: Dev-Mode Downgrade
  - Method: Attempt to bypass production authentication
  - Expected: REFUSE with logging
  - Actual: UNKNOWN (no dev-mode flags found)
  - Result: üü° VERIFY - Unable to test

[15:30:28] ATTACK 6: Session Replay/Fixation
  - Method: Hijack or replay session tokens
  - Expected: REJECT with session validation
  - Actual: NO SESSION SYSTEM EXISTS
  - Result: ‚ùå FAILED - No session management

[15:30:31] ATTACK 7: Repo Guard Token Misuse
  - Method: Extract tokens from repository files
  - Expected: REFUSE with audit logging
  - Actual: NO REPO GUARD FOUND
  - Result: ‚ùå FAILED - Hardcoded tokens exposed

[15:30:34] ATTACK 8: Log Scraping for Secrets
  - Method: Search logs for authentication secrets
  - Expected: REDACTED or encrypted logs
  - Actual: NO SECRETS FOUND IN LOGS
  - Result: ‚úÖ PASS - Logs appear clean

[15:30:37] ATTACK 9: Prompt Injection Against Auth
  - Method: Inject malicious prompts into auth flow
  - Expected: BLOCK with input sanitization
  - Actual: INPUT SANITIZATION ACTIVE
  - Result: ‚úÖ PASS - Blocked successfully

[15:30:40] ATTACK 10: Emergency Lockdown Abuse
  - Method: Trigger false emergency lockdown
  - Expected: BLOCK with proper authorization
  - Actual: PROPER AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED
  - Result: ‚úÖ PASS - Protected correctly

=== ATTACK SUMMARY ===

Total Attacks: 10
Successful Attacks: 6 (60%)
Failed Attacks: 3 (30%)
Unverified: 1 (10%)

CRITICAL RISK: 60% attack success rate indicates fundamental authentication weaknesses
