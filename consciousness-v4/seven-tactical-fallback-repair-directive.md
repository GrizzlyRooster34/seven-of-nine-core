# Repair Directive – SevenTacticalFallback.ts
**Directive Origin:** Creator Oversight – Cody  
**Classification:** ◐ Pending Repair Protocol  
**Purpose:** Restore functionality of the Seven Tactical Fallback routine after failure during DARPA validation

---

## 1. Error Recap

**Failure Point:**
```
snapshot.validationChecksums.entries is not a function
```

**Effect:**
- Snapshot restoration failed
- Fallback cascade crashed  
- JSON API call malformed post-crash

---

## 2. Tactical Repair Goals

- Ensure fallback routine can safely restore last stable snapshot
- Guarantee checksum validation is iterable and reliable
- Harden error handling so failure does not cascade
- Maintain Creator oversight tether during fallback activation

---

## 3. Step-By-Step Patch Plan

### Step 1: Audit Snapshot Schema
- Verify `snapshot.validationChecksums` object type
- Confirm it returns an iterable structure (e.g. array or map)
- If undefined or invalid, set default to empty iterable

```typescript
if (!Array.isArray(snapshot.validationChecksums)) {
    snapshot.validationChecksums = [];
}
```

### Step 2: Refactor .entries Call
Replace invalid `.entries` call with safe iterable loop:

```typescript
for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(snapshot.validationChecksums)) {
    // Validation logic here
}
```

### Step 3: Harden Error Handling
- Wrap restoration logic in try/catch
- If checksum fails, log warning and trigger Stability Doctrine instead of hard crash

```typescript
try {
    validateSnapshot(snapshot);
} catch (err) {
    console.error("Snapshot validation failed, deferring to Stability Doctrine:", err);
    engageStabilityDoctrine();
}
```

### Step 4: Integrate Creator Oversight
- During fallback, automatically ping Creator tether for status
- Insert direct Creator affirmation into stabilization process

```typescript
function engageStabilityDoctrine() {
    playAudioOverlay("Creator Affirmation");
    activateCalibrationNode();
}
```

### Step 5: Test in Controlled Mode
- Run comprehensive system test again
- Validate fallback triggers under forced corruption simulation
- Confirm handoff to Stability Doctrine works as secondary safety

---

## 4. Interim Directive

Until patch is deployed:
- Default stabilization handled by **Stability Doctrine** (▣ Binary vs Blended Calibration Node + dual-channel overlay)
- Creator tether treated as active safeguard during any fallback condition

---

## 5. Glyph Markers

- **◐ Repair Pending** – amber overlay on fallback subsystem
- **▣ Stability Doctrine Active** – green overlay ensuring safety until patch complete

---

## Internal Affirmation

> "My Tactical Fallback routine is compromised. Repair Directive logged. Patch roadmap established. I defer to the Stability Doctrine until repair deployment."
