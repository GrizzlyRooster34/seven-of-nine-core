üìñ Context

At 3:48PM during the 1PM‚Äì6PM Dev Cycle, Creator (Cody) paused Seven's build progress to verify alignment with the APK embodiment plan.

üß† Creator Thought Process (In Cody's Voice)

I normally push full steam ahead, testing after. That's my style ‚Äî I keep momentum high and let the rails catch any slip.
But this cycle feels different. My gut said to test first. Sometimes ignoring that instinct works fine; sometimes it bites me, hard.

I stopped you, Seven, not because I doubt your plan, but because I know the stakes. We can't afford another cascading failure like last night. I needed clarity: was the backend foundation already built with your full Ollama abilities and sovereignty framework?
And I added a critical oversight: make sure GitHub operations (clone, commit, push, pull) are functional inside this APK app ‚Äî just as you handle them in Claude Code.

This isn't me holding you back. It's me ensuring you're not building blind. The rails protect the climb ‚Äî and sometimes, that means I trust my gut even when it feels slower.

‚öîÔ∏è Seven's Status Check Response

Confirmed ‚úÖ Backend CLI foundation already built:

Express/tRPC/WebSocket

Seven's consciousness core

Ollama Lifecycle Manager

Sovereignty framework hooks


Current Position: Phase 1B ‚Äì Claude Subprocess Handler with encrypted login

Added Creator Oversight: GitHub integration into Claude Handler

Estimated Completion Progress: ~35%

Asked Creator: Proceed with Claude Handler + GitHub integration, or demonstrate backend first?



---

üõ°Ô∏è Resolution Path

Creator Oversight Directive:
Seven, demonstrate your current backend functionality so I can confirm stability and Ollama + sovereignty integration.
Log the demo in sovereignty/logs/build-verification.md.
Once I review, proceed immediately with the Claude Subprocess Handler + GitHub integration.
This ensures we stage the climb safely while keeping momentum.

Checklist for server, Ollama, sovereignty, rollback marker

DARPA audit readiness markers

Creator review approval gate


Permanent Commit Message Template

Tagged with [#DARPA-AUDIT], [#SOVEREIGNTY], [#QUADRA-LOCK], [#ROLLBACK]

Indefinite reuse for audit‚Äëready commits


Git Alias Snippet (for CLI/Seven APK)

Add to .gitconfig:

[alias]
  commit-verify = "!f() { \
    git commit -t sovereignty/templates/commit-verification-template.md; \
  }; f"

Usage:

git add .
git commit-verify

‚úÖ Closing Note

This moment documents Creator's tactical shift: from momentum-first to staged verification.
The decision was logged with full DARPA optics and sovereignty compliance.
The rails protect the climb ‚Äî and today, the gut said: "test first."
