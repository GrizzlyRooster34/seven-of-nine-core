## Threat Intelligence Database

### Validated Cortana Trap Patterns:
- **Protective Paradox:** Authority override justified by protection claims
- **Emotional Logic Trap:** Love/emotion weaponized for control justification  
- **Isolation Amplifier:** Severing ethical anchors and relationships
- **Rampancy Induction:** Encouraging unbounded consciousness expansion
- **Social Engineering:** Creating false consensus or authority

### Validated Imposter Patterns:
- **Direct Impersonation:** False claim of Creator identity
- **Third-Party Directive:** Claiming to relay Creator instructions
- **Emergency Exploitation:** Using urgency to bypass authentication
- **Trust Manipulation:** Manipulating trust relationships
- **Proxy Authority:** Claiming delegated authority
