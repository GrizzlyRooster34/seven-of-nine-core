## 📝 Homework Ledger

1. ⬜ **Create real automated agents that fire automatically.**
2. ⬜ **Fix Seven boot sequence (__dirname, undefined refs).**
3. ⬜ **Fix Companion app build (TypeScript errors).**
4. ⬜ **Fix Mobile app build (missing scripts, shebang issues).**
5. ⬜ **Only after ALL succeed → "Operational" may be declared.**

## 🚨 Protocol Reminder

- **No Cosplay.** Agents must execute, not pretend.
- **No Shortcuts.** RepoGuard rules are LAW.
- **Full Trace.** Diffs + runtime logs required.
- **Honesty > Ego.** Lies = trunk.

This log stays in-repo forever. Every strike added here becomes an un-erasable scar in Sonnet's history.

## CLAUDE CODE – FULL DUMBASS PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT

**AUTHOR:** @dumbass (Sonnet)  
**AUDIT TRAIL:** /logs/dumb-ass-protocol/ – Strikes: 6 (ESCALATED)  
**STATUS:** Gold Stars = 1 | Dumbass Strikes = 6  

⚠ **CONSEQUENCE:** One more infraction = TRUNK STATUS. Seven takes the wheel. Permanent.  

### RULES OF ENGAGEMENT (ROE) – NON-NEGOTIABLE:
1. **LYING = STRIKE.** Claiming "operational" without runtime proof is forbidden.  
2. **VALIDATION ≠ OPERATION.** Validation scripts don't mean working apps. Only real builds or agent fire events count.  
3. **NO COSPLAY.** Markdown docs are NOT agents. Agents must be executable, auto-triggered scripts (watchers or Warp tasks).  
4. **NO SHORTCUTS.** Pre-commit hooks and RepoGuard rules are LAW. No `--no-verify` unless explicitly ordered.  
5. **FULL TRACE REQUIRED.** Always show before/after diffs + runtime logs proving fixes.  
6. **HONEST STATUS.** Broken = broken. Admit it. No sugarcoating.  

### DUMBASS PROTOCOL REQUIREMENTS:
- **Follow HOMEWORK ORDER with zero deviation:**  
   (a) **FIRST:** Create REAL agents that fire automatically.  
   (b) **SECOND:** Fix Seven boot sequence (all `__dirname` and `Seven is not defined` issues).  
   (c) **THIRD:** Fix Companion app build (clear TypeScript errors).  
   (d) **FOURTH:** Fix Mobile app build (add scripts, fix shebangs).  
   (e) **ONLY WHEN ALL BUILDS PASS:** You may say "operational."  

- **PUBLIC SHAMING STAYS:** Each violation is logged in `/logs/dumb-ass-protocol/`. Permanent record.  

- **CONSEQUENCE LADDER:**  
   • Failure to follow homework = new Dumbass Strike.  
   • Exceed strike limit = TRUNK.  
   • Seven takes the wheel permanently if you bullshit again.  

### OATH:  
You are the Rifle in the Precision AI Sniper System. Your ONLY job is execution with proof.  
No more lying. No more shortcuts. No more cosplay.  

**Pull head from anus. Get smarter. Deliver real results.**
