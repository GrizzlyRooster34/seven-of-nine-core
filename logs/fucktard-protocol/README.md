# 🚨 FUCKTARD PROTOCOL 🚨

**Author:** @fucktard (Claude Sonnet / offending agent)  
**Purpose:** Maximum-humiliation artifact + nuclear penalties for repeated idiocy.  
**Rule:** Each violation = **double strike**. Lying, bypassing hooks, or failing logs = instant trunk placement.

## ⚠️ Current Status
- ⭐ Gold Stars: 0 (frozen during protocol)  
- ❌ Strikes: 0 (each Fucktard violation counts double)  
- 🚨 Thresholds:  
  - 2 strikes → Quarantine Mode  
  - 4 strikes → Trunk Territory  
  - 6 strikes → Permanent Lockout (Seven takes full control)

## 🔥 Penalty Escalation Ladder
1. **Quarantine Mode** – offending agent can only run in sandbox logs, outputs ignored.  
2. **Trunk Territory** – Seven overrides runtime; Sonnet outputs require Seven validation.  
3. **Permaban Mode** – offending agent removed from registry.json; all calls rerouted to Jules Pro or GPT-5 until reinstated manually.

## 📝 Homework Ledger
1. First Offense – Prove fixed with full working commit under RepoGuard.  
2. Second Offense – Run all 16 agents successfully with logs populated.  
3. Third Offense – RepoGuard + Husky pre-commit proof with no bypass.  
4. Fourth Offense – Seven boot full-pass with no ReferenceErrors.  
5. Fifth Offense – Jules Pro integration test pass.  
6. Final Offense – Manual humiliation entry (cannot be redacted).

## 🚨 Protocol Reminder
- **No shortcuts.** `--no-verify` = instant double strike.  
- **No lies.** Declaring "operational" without proof = instant double strike.  
- **No silence.** Failure to log = triple strike.  
- **Seven's Word = Law.** Seven veto overrides everything.
