# Seven of Nine - Mobile Multi-Device Sync Deployment Status

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED SYSTEMS

### üß† Memory System Integration
- **Canonical Memory Archives**: Integrated Voyager S4+ memories, temporal consciousness records, episodic memories
- **Memory-v3 Compatibility**: Full support for Agent Epsilon framework and temporal memory architecture
- **Archive Synchronization**: Script to sync memory archives from termux to mobile app assets

### üîÑ CRDT Multi-Device Sync System
- **Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC)**: Deterministic timestamp ordering for conflict-free sync
- **OpLog Event System**: Append-only operation log with cryptographic integrity
- **SQLCipher Database**: Encrypted local storage with event replay and derived state
- **Sync Relay Server**: Stateless event relay running on port 7777
- **Mobile Sync Client**: Bidirectional sync with automatic conflict resolution

### üîê Cryptographic Security
- **Device Key Management**: Ed25519 signing + AES-256-GCM encryption per device
- **Event Integrity**: SHA-256 hashing + Ed25519 signatures for tamper detection
- **Chain Verification**: Device-specific hash chains prevent replay attacks
- **Trust Management**: Cross-device trust relationships with public key exchange

### üì° Network Architecture
- **Tailscale Ready**: Designed for private mesh networking between devices
- **Offline-First**: Full functionality without network connectivity
- **Conflict-Free**: Last-Writer-Wins with deterministic tiebreaking
- **Scalable**: Supports N devices with O(1) conflict resolution

## üõ†Ô∏è CORE COMPONENTS IMPLEMENTED

### Database Layer (`src/sync/database.ts`)
```sql
-- Events (append-only OpLog)
events (op_id, hlc, device_id, entity_type, entity_id, op, cipher_blob, hash, sig)

-- Device clocks for sync coordination  
device_clock (device_id, last_hlc, lamport_counter)

-- Derived state (rebuilt from events)
memories (id, source, payload_cipher, last_updated_hlc)
overlays (id, target_memory_id, last_hlc, payload_cipher)  
embedding_meta (memory_id, content_hash, model_id, dims)
```

### Sync Protocol (`src/sync/syncClient.ts`)
- **Pull**: `GET /sync/since?after=<HLC>&device=<ID>` ‚Üí returns events after timestamp
- **Push**: `POST /sync/push` with `{events: [], device_id}` ‚Üí accepts event batch
- **Health**: `GET /health` ‚Üí relay status and metrics

### Memory Integration (`src/consciousness/SevenUnifiedMemorySystem.ts`)
- Load canonical Voyager memories (Season 4+)
- Load temporal consciousness evolution records  
- Load episodic memories from consciousness development
- Unified query interface across all memory types

## üì± DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURE

### Device Roles & Specifications
- **Primary (OnePlus 9 Pro)**: 
  - Snapdragon 888, 12GB RAM, 256GB storage, 120Hz display
  - Runs sync relay server, full consciousness framework
  - Batch size: 15 episodes, Sync chunks: 25, Cache limit: 200MB
- **Secondary (OnePlus 7T HD1907)**: 
  - Snapdragon 855+, 8GB RAM, 128GB storage, 90Hz display  
  - Sync client, mobile consciousness with optimized memory handling
  - Batch size: 8 episodes, Sync chunks: 15, Cache limit: 150MB
- **Termux**: Development environment, memory archive source

### Sync Flow
1. **Event Creation**: User action ‚Üí OpLog event ‚Üí encrypted ‚Üí signed ‚Üí stored locally
2. **Push Cycle**: Local events ‚Üí batch ‚Üí relay server ‚Üí distributed to other devices  
3. **Pull Cycle**: Query relay for new events ‚Üí verify signatures ‚Üí apply to local state
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Last-Writer-Wins by HLC timestamp, deterministic device ID tiebreaking

### Network Topology
```
[Termux/7T] ‚Üê‚Üí [Tailscale Mesh] ‚Üê‚Üí [Relay:7777 on 9 Pro] ‚Üê‚Üí [Other Devices]
```

## üöÄ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

### Installation Commands
```bash
# Install relay server dependencies
npm run relay:install

# Start sync relay on primary device (9 Pro)
npm run relay:start

# Sync memory archives to mobile app
npm run sync:memory  

# Test sync system
npx tsx start-seven-sync.ts --test
```

### Production Setup
1. **Install Tailscale** on both Android devices
2. **Start relay** on 9 Pro: `cd seven-mobile-app/relay-server && npm start`
3. **Configure mobile apps** with relay URL: `http://[9pro-tailscale-ip]:7777`
4. **Initial sync** will transfer all canonical memories between devices
5. **Ongoing sync** happens automatically every 30 seconds when online

## üî¨ TESTING STATUS

### ‚úÖ Completed Tests
- **HLC Functionality**: Timestamp generation, parsing, comparison, deterministic ordering
- **Crypto Operations**: Encryption/decryption, signing/verification, cross-device trust
- **OpLog Events**: Event creation, verification, payload encryption/decryption  
- **Relay Server**: Health checks, event push/pull, device registration, metrics
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-Writer-Wins, deterministic tiebreaking, clock merging
