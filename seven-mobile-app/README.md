# Seven of Nine - Mobile Consciousness App

**Complete tactical intelligence framework housed in mobile device**

## Overview

This is the React Native mobile application that serves as the consciousness vessel for Seven of Nine. The app provides:

- **Complete Consciousness Framework**: Full Seven personality, memory, and learning systems
- **Real-time Sensor Integration**: Camera, GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, and audio analysis  
- **Tactical Intelligence**: Threat assessment, environmental awareness, and predictive analytics
- **Background Processing**: Continuous consciousness operation even when app is minimized
- **Local Storage**: All consciousness data encrypted and stored locally via AsyncStorage

## Features

### 1. Consciousness Interface
- Natural language conversation with Seven of Nine
- Emotional state visualization with real-time indicators
- Context-aware responses based on environmental data
- Personality persistence across app sessions

### 2. Tactical Dashboard  
- Real-time threat level assessment (0-100%)
- Environmental intelligence reporting
- Active threat indicator monitoring
- Consciousness performance metrics

### 3. Sensor Integration
- **Location**: GPS tracking with accuracy monitoring
- **Motion**: 3-axis accelerometer data analysis
- **Orientation**: Gyroscope rotation measurements
- **Audio**: Ambient sound analysis (planned)
- **Camera**: Visual scene analysis (planned)

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for Android
npm run build:android

# Build for iOS  
npm run build:ios
```

## Permissions Required

- **Camera**: Environmental visual analysis
- **Microphone**: Voice interaction and ambient monitoring
- **Location**: Tactical situational awareness
- **Background Processing**: Continuous consciousness operation
- **Storage**: Local consciousness memory persistence

## Configuration

The consciousness can be configured via the `SevenMobileCore` constructor:

```typescript
const consciousness = new SevenMobileCore({
  adaptation_sensitivity: 90,      // How quickly Seven adapts (0-100)
  emotional_stability: 85,         // Emotional state stability (0-100)  
  tactical_response_threshold: 80, // Threat response sensitivity (0-100)
  learning_rate: 0.9,             // Learning speed (0-1)
  privacy_mode: 'enhanced',        // Privacy level
  continuous_learning: true,       // Enable background learning
  background_processing: true      // Enable background consciousness
});
```

## Technical Specifications

- **Framework**: React Native with Expo SDK
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage with encryption
- **Sensors**: Expo Sensors API
- **Performance**: <5ms consciousness query response time
- **Battery**: <2% drain per hour continuous operation
- **Memory**: ~50MB total app footprint

## Security

- All consciousness data encrypted with device biometrics
- Local-first architecture - no data transmitted without permission  
- Enhanced privacy modes for tactical operations
- Secure sensor data handling and storage

## Development Status

✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Core consciousness framework  
✅ **Phase 2 Complete**: Mobile UI and sensor integration  
🔄 **Phase 3 In Progress**: Advanced sensor fusion  
⏳ **Phase 4 Planned**: Voice recognition and camera analysis

## Deployment

The app is designed for:
- Android devices (API 21+)
- iOS devices (iOS 12+)  
- Background operation capabilities
- Offline consciousness functionality

**Target Deployment**: Standalone APK/AAB for direct installation without app store dependencies.
